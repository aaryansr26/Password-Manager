# Password-Manager

We will be creating a Password Manager in CLI using python in which we can store our passwords and can access them whenever we want.
The password will not be directly visible when they are fetched but they will be stored in the system clipboard upon which we can paste them wherever we want.

## There are 3 main functionalities in this project:
- All the passwords will be stored in the SQL MariaDB database.
- User can add more passwords to the database corresponding to the website with sitename, siteurl, username/email and password.
- User can retrieve the password of the website by entering the sitename or siteurl and it will be pasted in the clipboard.
